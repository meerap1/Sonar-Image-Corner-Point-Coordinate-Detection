## Introduction
The project focuses on developing a machine learning model capable of detecting and marking the coordinates of corner points in sonar images. In this project, we aim to implement algorithms that can automatically identify and extract corner points from sonar images.In this project, we aim to implement algorithms that can automatically identify and extract corner points from sonar images. By employing machine learning techniques, we seek to train models to recognize patterns associated with corner points in the image data. These models will be trained on labeled datasets containing sonar images along with the corresponding coordinates of corner points. The trained model will then be able to predict the coordinates of corner points in new, unseen sonar images. Overall, the goal of this project is to develop an efficient and accurate system for corner point coordinate detection in sonar images.
